## :dart: About ##

This is a simple scropt package set up for BloonsTk that includes an auto healing script, as well as an auto follow tool. This open source project is an extention of freedomPoet 4.4 that has been un maintained for about 4-5 years.

## :sparkles: Features ##

:heavy_check_mark: Automatic Poeting Macro.
:heavy_check_mark: Semi Automatic Follow Script.
:heavy_check_mark: Support for Bard Class.

## :rocket: Technologies ##

The following tools were used in this project:

- [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

## :dart: Requirements ##

Before starting :checkered_flag:, you need to have [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.

## :rocket: How to Run ##

1. Clone this repository or download as a zip if you are unfamiliar.

2. If you have not, install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) 

3. In the main directory of autohotkey (program files for windows users) create a new folder named lib, and place the classMemory file into that new folder.

4. At this point you may use freedomPoet or freedomBard simply by launching the script and having your poet as the first indexed window (requires the poet to be in the freedompoet1 window). 


## :computer: Controls 

### freedomPoet and freedomBard controls:

* ctrl + f12 - Loads the script and tool tip
* f12 - toggles the script on and off
* f8 - Old Sc toggle (Magibane with toggle off on no mobs in area)
* f10 - New SC Toggle Auto, It scans on an off in a 10 second interval (Timer can be adjusted in the script)
* Shift + f12 - Toggles spire (Set group member and 1 for yes)
* alt + f12 - Reset ASV on target group member
* Key bindings can be adjusted in the botlauncher.ini file as desired or can be used as default (Make sure to unset any bindings you do not plan to use or set that number to a non spell, or comment out that code block in the script if you can!)

### Auto Follow Controls:

* This will only work once the windows are set to freedomPoet and the correct indexes.
* ctrl + f6 - Load script and tooltip
* shift + f6 - Sets the space count between followers and main char
* f6 - toggle follow on / off
* NOTE: Which ever window you are on will be the character that is followed.
