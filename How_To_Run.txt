THESE SCRIPTS NEED TO HAVE YOUR WINDOWS STACKED IN THE PROPER ORDER.  These scripts will rename your client windows "TKReborn1", "TKReborn2", "TKReborn3" and so on and will do it for however many clients you set in the .ini for "boxes = #" The windows need to be layered properly.  Most recent TKReborn client active is going to be "TKReborn1", the 2nd most active is going to be "TKReborn2" and so on.  YOU MUST HAVE WINDOWS STACKED IN THE PROPER ORDER or the wrong chars will be trying to cast the wrong spells.
